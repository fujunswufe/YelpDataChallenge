# YelpDataChallenge
This is the project for Yelp Data Challenge

## Clean text
1. Do we need to translate numbers into words
2. How to deal with some unmeaningful words in English, such as yammmmmm and Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm? remove it or not?
3. how do the computer check this kind of sentence __"We do n't have pizza like this in Hawaii , unfortunately"__. I think we need to convert this sentence to its standard form like this one __"We do not have pizza like this in Hawaii , unfortunately"__.
